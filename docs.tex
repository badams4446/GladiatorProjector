\section{Aerodynamic Equations}
Here are some example aerodynamic equations used in the analysis of flight dynamics:

\subsection{Lift Equation}
The lift force generated by an object is given by:
\begin{equation}
    L = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 C_L A
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $L$ is the lift force (N),
    \item $\rho$ is the air density (kg/m\(^3\)),
    \item $v$ is the velocity of the object relative to the air (m/s),
    \item $C_L$ is the lift coefficient (dimensionless),
    \item $A$ is the reference area (m\(^2\)).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Drag Equation}
The drag force acting on an object is given by:
\begin{equation}
    D = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 C_D A
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $D$ is the drag force (N),
    \item $C_D$ is the drag coefficient (dimensionless).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reynolds Number}
The Reynolds number, a dimensionless quantity, is used to predict flow patterns in different fluid flow situations:
\begin{equation}
    Re = \frac{\rho v L}{\mu}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $Re$ is the Reynolds number,
    \item $L$ is the characteristic length (m),
    \item $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid (PaÂ·s).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Bernoulli's Equation}
Bernoulli's principle for incompressible flow is expressed as:
\begin{equation}
    P + \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 + \rho g h = \text{constant}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $P$ is the static pressure (Pa),
    \item $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity (m/s\(^2\)),
    \item $h$ is the height above a reference point (m).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Equation of Continuity}
The equation of continuity for incompressible flow is:
\begin{equation}
    A_1 v_1 = A_2 v_2
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $A_1$ and $A_2$ are the cross-sectional areas (m\(^2\)),
    \item $v_1$ and $v_2$ are the flow velocities (m/s).
\end{itemize}

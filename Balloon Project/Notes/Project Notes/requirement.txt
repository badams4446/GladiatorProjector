Build avionics platform with Adafruit Clue board

    1. Read sensor data
    2. Perform analysis on data

    balloon slow 
    balloon powers the board


# Questions ----------------
- Did anyone get the board from the teacher

# Requirements 
- Adafruit Clue board
- Need to use LatEx
- Need one 
- Need one action
- data must be recorded

Adafruit Clue Board
- including temperature, humidity, pressure, 
- a 9-DOF IMU (Rate Gyro, Accelerometer, and Magnetometer), 
- and a light sensor
- color LCD, a RGB Neopixel LED, and Bluetooth capabilities


2MB of flash memory (code and data use same memory)

ClueBoard uses QWIIC to connet (I^2)C

Min of 1 sensor of recording data
Several sensors at 1 Hz, 

balloon itself collects GPS data with GPS timestamp data

Timestamp = 1 Hz each counter index be 1 second interzals 

Climb rate at 5 m/s, burst altitiude near 30 and 33 km
decent is near 4-6 m
highest decent near 10 m/s
parachute is in line with stack line
auto opens when the ballloon bursts

total flght time 2h33m
burst altitude 34161 meters
time to burst 108 min
ascent rate 5.26
